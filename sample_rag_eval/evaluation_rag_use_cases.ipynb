    "In this notebook, you will learn how to use the Vertex AI Rapid Evaluation SDK to evaluate components of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems have emerged as a powerful approach for improving the groundness, relevancy, and factuality of large language model (LLM) responses by combining the capabilities of LLMs with information retrieval techniques from external sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the various components of this system is crucial to ensure the quality of the overall response.  \n",

    "\n",
    " - **Question Rephrasing with LLM**: During the \"Search\" step, LLMs can rephrase user questions to improve retrieval accuracy, leading to more relevant and informative responses in RAG systems. Here you will evaluate the rephrased question.  \n",
    " - **Response from the RAG System**: Evaluate the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the final answer generated by the RAG System.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this diagram is a simplified representation of a RAG System.  \n",

    " - **Data Ingestion**: The system starts with various data sources, which can include web pages, files, databases, knowledge bases, etc.\n",
    " - **Preprocessing**: The data is parsed and chunked by Document AI or with your custom scripts, and stored in Cloud Storage.\n",
    " - **Embedding and Storage**: The processed data is then converted into vector embeddings using a Vertex AI Embeddings model, and these embeddings are stored in Vertex AI Vector Search.\n",
    " - **User Query**: When a user submits a query, it is first rephrased using Vertex AI Gemini and converted into an embedding.\n",
    " - **Retrieval**: The query embedding is used to search the stored embeddings and return the most relevant documents.\n",
    " - **Answer Generation**: Finally, Vertex AI Gemini utilizes the retrieved documents and the rephrased question to generate a comprehensive and contextually relevant answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this system architecture, we will provide some guidelines to evaluate the rephrased user question and the final response from the RAG System.\n",
